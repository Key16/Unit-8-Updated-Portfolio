# This is a portfolio of Jess using only CSS and HTML

Welcome to my first portfolio built from scratch using only CSS and HTML. It has been built to be responsive to both desktop and mobile. 

The first thing you'll see is a Nav bar, if you hover over the list items on desktop, it will create a drop shadow and if clicked, will scroll to the corresponding section in the HTML. On mobile, it'll also appear as a drop shadow and scroll smoothly down to the section. If Github is selected, the link will open in a new tab. If the screensize is changed, I added a smooth transition for the nav bar when the media query kicks in. 

The next section is the Intro and Picture of my 'first project' (Project A). These are all currently linked to just photos, if you hover over the words 'project A' it'll take you to the photo source. This is built as a flex box and wraps to the next row depending on which screen you view it on.

The Other projects section is also a flex box and will stretch and wrap depending on which device you view. The circles of the projects will direct you to the image source as well in a new tab. 

The footer contains ways to contact me, in the form of image logos that will redirect you to placeholder social media links. This is also a flex box and will wrap into two rows on mobile. 

## CSS properties not shown on webpage

I added a variable for the colours if i wanted to change the background colours. 

This was my framework before i built the site
